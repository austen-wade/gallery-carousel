# Gallery of images carousel
This carousel of images uses HTML, SCSS and vanilla (ES6) Javascript.
Images are provided by source.unsplash.com/random

## Functionality
Javascript will get the width and height of the browser and request images to put in the carousel from Unsplash. The images will always stay the same size. If user expands browser from initial requests, the images will be surrounded by margin, as the Javascript modifies two CSS ::root variables whenever the page is resized.
